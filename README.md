# Team Cymru's Template Project

Team Cymru maintains a number of templates for community use.  We rely on community involvement and engagement for these templates and would encourage all that use them to **REVIEW** them before use.  It is **YOUR** network and while we offer these to help you, we urge you to make sure they fit your network.

These templates are made possible by a number of community efforts.  Team Cymru is the custodian, but we need your help to keep these current and make them better!  Please consider submitting pull requests if you have suggestions for improvement!  If you prefer, please contact us at [outreach@cymru.com](mailto:outreach@cymru.com).
